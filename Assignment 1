So, we're on to our first project! Congratulations. This assignment will test your ability to execute basic functions in Pandas. 
Return to this tab when you have correctly loaded in your data and you wish to challenge yourself by completing the tasks associated with this project!

Task 1: You will notice several columns are outside the scope of interest for this project. Alter the dataframe so that only the columns of interest are included

Task 2: Create a frequency table so that the count for each age category (AgeC) can be viewed for the following categories: "All Participants", "Males", "Females".

Task 3: Although there are Age categories available to you in this dataframe, create a new column "Age Cat Epi" that categorizes age as follows: 18-35, 36-59, >60. 
        After that, create a frequency table so that counts are available for "All Participants", "Males", "Females"



The values for these columns have been randomly generated and do not accurately reflect secular health trends. This database is for training purposes.
